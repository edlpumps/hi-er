                        span The public can view and verify data on pumps with an HI Energy Rating (ER) Label. The ER Label is designed to clearly indicate the power savings obtained from pump system upgrades and changes. Manufacturers use the ER Label to differentiate products by power consumption. Public utilities and power companies can use the ER Label for incentive programs and rebates. Listed pumps have been tested at approved labs in accordance with HI 40.7.

                 | HI developed the standard, HI 40.6, for testing pumps and determining their efficiency in a uniform and consistent manner.  The US Department of Energy (DOE) published an Energy Conservation Standard (ECS) and Uniform Test Procedure (TP) for Pumps on January 27, 2016; and in the uniform test procedure, HI 40.6 is incorporated by reference.  The ECS and TP can be referenced at 10 CFR 431.465 and 10 CFR 431.464 & Appendix A to Subpart Y.
