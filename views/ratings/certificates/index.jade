                 | HI developed the standard, HI 40.6, for testing pumps and determining their efficiency in a uniform and consistent manner.  The US Department of Energy (DOE) published an Energy Conservation Standard (ECS) and Uniform Test Procedure (TP) for Pumps on January 27, 2016; and in the uniform test procedure, HI 40.6 is incorporated by reference.  The ECS and TP can be referenced at 10 CFR 431.465 and 10 CFR 431.464 & Appendix A to Subpart Y.
