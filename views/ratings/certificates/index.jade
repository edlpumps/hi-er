                 | The Hydraulic Institute acknowledges that applications may dictate that motors more efficient than the default in the guiding standards or continuous controls may be added to basic models listed in the Energy Rating Database. For these cases, Energy Rating Program participants, nonparticipants, and end-users may generate a Energy Rating (ER) Certificate that indicates the new Energy Rating. The ER Certificate is only available when a motor regulated under 10 CFR 431.25 with an efficiency greater than the default values in the guiding standards or a continuous control are added. ER Certificates are serialized and only applicable for one installation.
